Cars passing through the entrance are allowed immediate access; otherwise, a ticket is assigned with the entry time recorded. Within the parking garage with 50 spaces, Ultra-Sonic range sensors determine if a car is parked by measuring the distance. When parked, the corresponding LED turns off, and the 7-Segment display decreases the count of available spots. The Fire Sensor alerts if temperatures reach dangerous levels. Additionally, a vending machine offers various options like Coffee, Water, and Hot Chocolate. Press the desired button, pay the displayed price, and collect your drink.
